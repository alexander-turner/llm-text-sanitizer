/**
 * SSOT contract for the generated Unicode Joining_Type / virama tables.
 *
 * src/joining-type.mjs is generated from the vendored UCD slices by
 * scripts/gen-joining-type.mjs. This test re-derives the tables from the SAME
 * slices and asserts the committed module still agrees — so editing the source
 * data without regenerating (or a Stryker mutant flipping a range bound) fails
 * CI, exactly as an SSOT round-trip should.
 *
 * It checks EVERY covered code point plus the four boundary points around each
 * range (start-1, start, end, end+1). That is non-vacuous where it matters — an
 * off-by-one bound, a dropped range, or a mislabeled type surfaces as a concrete
 * mismatch — without the cost of iterating the full 0x10FFFF space twice. The
 * gaps between ranges all map to the default (U / false) by construction, so the
 * one boundary point on each side of every range pins the transition; sampling
 * the interior of every range then rules out an interior mislabel.
