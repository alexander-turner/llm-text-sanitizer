/**
 * Lazy-load invariant: importing the package root (`index.mjs`) must NOT pull
 * in the heavy HTML layer (`html.mjs` and its remark/rehype/unified graph,
 * ~200ms of module-load time). The root only `await import()`s that module
 * inside `sanitize({ html: true })`; everything it re-exports at module scope —
 * including the Layer 2/3 pre-gates — comes from the dependency-free
 * `gates.mjs`, never from `html.mjs`.
 *
 * This is the entire rationale for extracting `gates.mjs`, so it gets a
 * behavioral guard: a future `export … from "./html.mjs"` slipped into
 * `index.mjs` would silently reintroduce the eager load, and only this test
 * would catch it. We record the real module-resolution graph via a `module`
 * customization hook rather than grepping source, so the assertion tracks what
 * actually loads, not what the imports happen to look like.
