/**
 * SSOT obligation gate: every public function that parses or transforms
 * untrusted input MUST be exercised by at least one property/fuzz suite. This
 * is the same one-test-per-member discipline the enumerated-member tests use
 * (each LINGUISTIC_SCRIPTS / CHECKS / REPORTED_TAGS entry), extended to "every
 * entry point that eats attacker-controlled bytes is fuzzed."
 *
 * Why an obligation gate rather than a coverage percentage: line coverage was
 * already 100% when a real under-stripping bug (U+009B passthrough) shipped,
 * because a passthrough executes the line without violating any asserted
 * invariant. A percentage can't catch "this parser has no security invariant";
 * requiring a named fuzz target for each one can.
