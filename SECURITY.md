# Security Policy

`agent-input-sanitizer` is a security library: it sits between untrusted text
and a model, so a vulnerability here can defeat the very protection a downstream
pipeline is relying on. Please treat reports accordingly.

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public GitHub issue for a security vulnerability.** A public
report tips off attackers before downstream users can update.

Instead, report privately through one of:

- GitHub's [private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/alexander-turner/agent-input-sanitizer/security/advisories/new)
  ("Report a vulnerability" under the **Security** tab), or
- email the maintainer at `security@turntrout.com`.

Please include enough to reproduce: the input that triggers it, the entry point
(`/invisible`, `/html`, `/confusables`, `/rehydrate`, etc.), what the sanitizer
did versus what it should have done, and the package version.

A bypass that lets payload-capable content reach the model unflagged, a splice
that exposes a secret, or a crash on adversarial input are all in scope. Please
don't include real credentials in a report—a credential-shaped placeholder is
enough.

## What to expect

The maintainer will acknowledge your report and work with you on a fix and a
coordinated disclosure timeline before any public detail is published. Fixes
ship in a patched release with the advisory.
