# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve `agent-input-sanitizer`. This is a security library,
so the bar for changes to the detection and transform layers is high—read the
notes below before opening a PR.

## Setup

Use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) (not npm) for all package operations.

```bash
pnpm install   # installs deps and configures git hooks (core.hooksPath .hooks)
```

## Workflow

```bash
pnpm test      # c8 node --test (the JS test suite, with coverage)
pnpm lint      # eslint .
pnpm check     # tsc --noEmit (type-check)
pnpm format    # prettier --write .
```

Run the tests, lint, type-check, and formatter before pushing. The git hooks
under `.hooks/` also enforce formatting and commit conventions on commit.

## Commits

Commits **must** follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
`<type>(<scope>): <description>`. The `commit-msg` hook rejects anything else.
Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `ci`, `chore`, `style`,
`perf`, `build`. Use `!` (e.g. `feat!:`) for breaking changes.

Write each subject as a **user-facing release note**: the commit subjects since
the last release are the single source of truth for the version bump and the
generated changelog. Keep internal churn out of the notes by typing it as
`test` / `ci` / `refactor` / `chore`.

**Do not hand-edit `CHANGELOG.md` or bump `package.json`'s version.** On merge to
`main`, the `auto-version` workflow derives the semver bump from the commit
subjects, publishes to npm, promotes the `## Unreleased` heading to a dated
section, and tags the release.

## Code style and tests

- **Favor precision over recall in the detection/transform layers.** A false
  positive—mangling or splicing legitimate content—is a real harm, and noisy
  flags train operators to ignore the signal. When a heuristic can't cleanly
  separate a true payload from benign input, prefer the false negative and say
  so. Validate against the actual parser/tokenizer, not an approximation; fail
  _open_ (treat as benign) on input you can't resolve.
- **Fail loudly.** Throw on unexpected input rather than swallowing it; let
  exceptions propagate unless there's a specific, necessary recovery.
- **Pair every new detector with negative tests** over a corpus of legitimate
  inputs asserting zero findings, and pin structural invariants
  (idempotence, output-is-a-subsequence, never-throws on adversarial input) with
  property/fuzz tests (`fast-check`), not just hand-picked examples.
- Don't skip or weaken existing tests. Prefer exact-equality assertions.

## Pull requests

When a feature, fix, or refactor is complete, open a PR—keep it focused, explain
what changed and how you verified it, and fill in the template. Don't include
real secrets or tokens anywhere in the PR.

## Reporting vulnerabilities

For security issues, **do not open a public issue**—see [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
