"""Tests for the Python client (`python/agent_input_sanitizer`).

The client is a thin bridge to the Node CLI, so these assert the bridge holds:
Layer 1 strips, the html flag reaches Layers 2/3, the persistent worker agrees
with the one-shot path, and a missing Node fails loudly. The sanitization
verdicts themselves are owned by the JS suite — here the CLI is the source of
truth and the client must faithfully relay it.
