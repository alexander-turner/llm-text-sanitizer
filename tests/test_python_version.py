"""Guard the Python client's version-coupling contract.

Because the wheel bundles a build of `src/`, the Python distribution and the npm
package are the same logic in two ecosystems, so they share ONE version. The
release workflow derives it from Conventional Commits, publishes npm and PyPI at
that number from the same commit, and injects it into `python/pyproject.toml` at
build time (working tree only) — exactly as it injects the npm version into
package.json. The committed `python/pyproject.toml` version is therefore a frozen
`0.0.0` placeholder, never shipped.

Two ways this rots: a maintainer hand-edits the placeholder thinking it drives
the release (it doesn't), or the old "independent, hand-bumped" policy creeps
back into the docs. This pins the sentinel and asserts the coupling rationale is
written down, so either slip fails CI.
