"""The base package must stay dependency-free.

A headline guarantee of the `secrets` extra is that every ``detect-secrets``
import lives inside ``agent_input_sanitizer.secrets`` — so a plain
``import agent_input_sanitizer`` never pulls in the optional dependency. This
guards that invariant: it breaks the day someone adds a top-level
``from .secrets import ...`` to the base package, which would silently make the
base install require detect-secrets.
