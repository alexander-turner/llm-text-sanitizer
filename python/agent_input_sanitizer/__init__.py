"""Python client for ``agent-input-sanitizer``.

The sanitization logic has a single source of truth: the JavaScript in
``src/``. This module is a thin client that shells out to the
``bin/sanitize-cli.mjs`` CLI, so a Python pipeline gets byte-identical verdicts
without a second implementation to keep in sync. It requires Node.js (>=20) on
``PATH``; there is deliberately no pure-Python fallback, because a port is
exactly the drift this design avoids.

Only the CLI's data-in/data-out entry points are wrapped; the agent-pipeline
seams that take an injected JS callback (homoglyph scanner, redactor, file
access) have no language-agnostic wire form and stay JS-only.

Entry points:

* :func:`sanitize` / :func:`sanitize_text` — clean text. The first pays the
  heavy ~200 ms HTML module-load only ONCE: the first ``html=True`` call spins
  up a shared, process-wide worker that later ``html=True`` calls reuse (Layer-1
  calls stay one-shot, leaving no process behind). Override with ``persist``.
* :func:`classify_prompt` — pass / note / block verdict for a user prompt.
* :func:`scan_instruction_files` / :func:`clean_file` — scan or strip
  hidden-Unicode payloads from instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, …).
* :class:`Sanitizer` — an explicitly-scoped long-lived worker (context manager).
* :func:`shutdown_worker` — tear down the shared worker eagerly (it is also torn
  down at interpreter exit).

The CLI caps a single request at ``AGENT_SANITIZER_MAX_INPUT_BYTES`` UTF-8 bytes
(default 10 MiB); a larger request fails with a clear error instead of buffering
an unbounded payload. Set that environment variable in the calling process to
raise or lower the limit.

Locating the CLI: the sanitizer's logic lives only in the JavaScript ``src/``,
and the wheel deliberately does **not** bundle it (a vendored copy would be the
exact drift this design avoids). So an installed package must be told where the
JS checkout's CLI lives. Resolution order:

#. ``AGENT_SANITIZER_CLI`` — an explicit path to ``sanitize-cli.mjs`` (or any
   compatible CLI). This is how a pip-installed package reaches the JS; point it
   at the ``bin/sanitize-cli.mjs`` of a cloned/``npm install``-ed checkout.
#. The source-tree sibling — when this module is imported from a repo checkout,
   the CLI is at ``<repo>/bin/sanitize-cli.mjs`` (two parents up).

If neither resolves, every entry point fails loudly with a message naming both
options, rather than an opaque ``node: Cannot find module``.
