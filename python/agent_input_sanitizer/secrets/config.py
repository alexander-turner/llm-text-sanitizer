The core discovers nothing about its environment: every value it needs — which
env-var *values* to redact by exact match, the invisible charset, whether the
text came from the web — is passed in through :class:`RedactorConfig`. This is
the decoupling that makes the engine agent-agnostic: claude-guard (or any
consumer) supplies its own provider/host-credential lists rather than the core
reading a monitor-providers.json or scanning ``os.environ``.

    ``provider_vars`` and ``host_cred_vars`` are each ``name -> current value``
    maps: the engine redacts every value by exact match and labels the redaction
    ``[REDACTED: <name>]``. They are kept as two fields only to mirror the
    caller's own split (inference-provider keys vs. host credentials the sandbox
    blanks); the engine unions them (provider first, deduped by name) into
    :attr:`env_secrets`. Passing values — not just names — is deliberate: a
    long-lived daemon may serve many sessions, so it must redact the *requester's*
    keys, not its own ``os.environ``.

    ``invisible_charset`` is the set of payload-capable invisible code points to
    strip before detection and to tolerate spliced inside env-bound keys. Leave
    it ``None`` (the default) to source it from agent-input-sanitizer's shared
    SSOT via :func:`~agent_input_sanitizer.secrets.invisible.default_charset` — the two
    layers MUST use the same set or a key spliced with a code point one omits
    escapes both. Resolving it raises if that shared dependency is absent (fail
    closed); pass an explicit set only to override for a test or a bespoke layer.
    ``web_ingress`` marks attacker-controlled text (disables the name-based
    benign-skip heuristics). ``high_confidence`` drops the fuzzy
    keyword/field-value detectors, leaving only detectors whose match shape IS
    the credential.
