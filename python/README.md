# agent-input-sanitizer (Python client)

A thin Python bridge to the [`agent-input-sanitizer`](https://github.com/AlexanderMattTurner/agent-input-sanitizer)
Node.js CLI. The sanitization logic has a single source of truth — the
JavaScript in `src/` — so this package shells out to the CLI rather than
re-implementing it, giving a Python pipeline byte-identical verdicts with no
second implementation to keep in sync.

## Requirements

- **Node.js (>= 22) on `PATH`.** The sanitizer is JavaScript; something has to
  run it. There is deliberately no pure-Python fallback.

That's it — `pip install agent-input-sanitizer` and, with Node available, you're
ready to go. The wheel ships a self-contained, single-file build of the CLI
(the `src/` logic and its npm dependencies bundled into one `.mjs` at release
time), so there is no separate JavaScript checkout to clone and no environment
variable to set. The bundle is a versioned build artifact from `src/`, not a
hand-maintained port, so it can't drift from the JS.

### Optional: point at your own JS checkout

Set `AGENT_SANITIZER_CLI` to a checkout's `bin/sanitize-cli.mjs` to override the
bundled CLI (e.g. to run against unreleased `src/` changes). When the module is
imported directly from a repo checkout, the source CLI is found automatically.

## Usage

```python
from agent_input_sanitizer import sanitize

result = sanitize("untrusted text", html=True)
print(result.cleaned, result.found, result.warnings)
```

See the package docstring for the full set of entry points (`sanitize_text`,
`classify_prompt`, `scan_instruction_files`, `clean_file`, and the long-lived
`Sanitizer` worker).

## Secret redaction (`[secrets]` extra)

The base install is dependency-free. The optional `secrets` extra adds a
pure-Python secret-redaction engine under `agent_input_sanitizer.secrets` —
detect-secrets plus custom detectors, benign-value skipping, cross-line
reassembly, PEM collapse, and exact-match redaction of caller-supplied env-var
values. Unlike the sanitizer above it needs **no Node.js**; its only dependency
is `detect-secrets`, pulled in by the extra:

```bash
pip install "agent-input-sanitizer[secrets]"
```

Every detect-secrets import lives inside this subpackage, so a plain
`import agent_input_sanitizer` never touches it. The engine shares the parent
package's invisible-character SSOT (`agent_input_sanitizer.invisible`) rather
than forking it — a fork would be a silent security regression.

### In-process

```python
from agent_input_sanitizer.secrets import RedactorConfig, redact, redact_map

redacted, found = redact("aws_key = AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE")
# -> ("aws_key = [REDACTED: AWS Access Key]", ["AWS Access Key"])

# Pass provider/host secret values in — config is supplied, never discovered.
cfg = RedactorConfig(host_cred_vars={"GH_TOKEN": "ghp_realtokenvalue123"})
redact("tok=ghp_realtokenvalue123", cfg)  # -> ("tok=[REDACTED: GH_TOKEN]", ["GH_TOKEN"])
```

### The rehydration map contract

`redact_map(text, config)` returns a lossless, two-way view:

```python
{"text": "<redacted>",
 "pairs": [{"placeholder": "[REDACTED: …]", "original": "<secret>", "start": <int>}],
 "found": ["<type>", ...]}
```

Substituting each `pair["original"]` at its `start` reconstructs the input
byte-for-byte. `start` is a **Unicode code-point** offset into `text` (the field
is `start`, not `start_offset`). U+E000 / U+E001 are reserved placeholder
sentinels: input already containing either is refused with
`{"unmappable": "input contains reserved sentinel characters"}` (fail closed)
rather than producing an ambiguous map.

### Daemon vs. one-shot

detect-secrets caches a process-global `secret_type → plugin` mapping, so a fresh
one-shot call must re-register the plugin set every time — slow under load. Two
console scripts (installed with the extra) cover both modes:

- **`agent-secret-redactor`** — one-shot: reads text on stdin, writes the
  redaction result as JSON on stdout. Re-registers plugins per call.
- **`agent-secret-redactor-daemon <socket-path>`** — long-lived Unix-socket
  server that configures the plugin set **once** at startup (a warm-up scan
  primes the cache before it binds, so a bound socket means ready). Wire protocol
  both directions: a 4-byte big-endian length prefix then that many bytes of
  UTF-8 JSON. Request `{"text", "map", "web_ingress", "env_secrets"}`; response is
  the one-shot result, JSON `null` when nothing is redacted, or `{"error": …}` on
  a scan failure.

Both console scripts import the engine on startup, so they fail loud if the
`[secrets]` extra (hence `detect-secrets`) is not installed — fail closed, never
a silent no-op.

## Versioning

This package is versioned in lockstep with the npm
[`agent-input-sanitizer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/agent-input-sanitizer):
each release publishes both at the same version from the same commit, and the
wheel bundles `src/` at exactly that version. So `pip install
agent-input-sanitizer==X.Y.Z` and `npm i agent-input-sanitizer@X.Y.Z` are the
same underlying logic.
