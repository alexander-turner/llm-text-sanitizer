# every documented `exports` subpath plus the `sanitize-cli` bin. This catches
# the class of bug that the in-repo `node --test` cannot — a `files` allowlist
# that drops a shipped module, a `prepack` that fails to emit types, or an
# install lifecycle script (`postinstall`/`prepare`) that assumes a git repo and
# crashes the consumer's `npm install`. We deliberately do NOT pass
# --ignore-scripts so a broken install hook fails the job here, not in the wild.
